# Machine Learning Project: Music Recommendation!

We will use the [million song dataset](http://www.kaggle.com/c/msdchallenge/data) [1]. 
This is available as an [Amazon Public Dataset snapshot](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets/6468931156960467), 
which can be attached to an Amazon EC2 virtual machine. To set up, you create an EBS disk instance from snap-5178cf30.

The challenge is to create the best recommendation system. Various features are included for the songs (tempo, title, year, [bag-of-words] lyrics, loudness, mfcc-like features, etc.)

Listening history of users is also provided.
